	<h1>Controllers</h1>

	<p>The purpose of a controller is to get the data necessary to render a template. It does this by creating a <code>context</code> object and resolving it on the response. When creating a <code>context</code> object, a controller has access to stored data as well as a number of data sources on the request, such as the session, query string, POST data, or the URL itself.</p>

	<p>All controllers must be passed to the configuration object on <code>breadbox.init</code>. For readability, it is recommended to use <code>require</code> to store them as modules in their own files:</p>

<code>const init = require('breadbox').init;

init({
	controllers: {
		'/index': require('./controllers/index')
	}
});
</code>
