	<h1>Intro</h1>

	<p>Breadbox is an MVC framework for Node.jsÂ®. It is currently in development and should not be used without expectation of breaking changes.</p>

	<p>Breadbox strives to provide a broad feature set in one small, simple package. Out of the box, it includes:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A template engine</li>
		<li>A file-based data store</li>
		<li>Error interceptors to relieve error handling annoyances</li>
		<li>Security features like automatic HTML escaping and CSRF protection</li>
		<li>Authentication and session mangement</li>
		<li>A promise object implementation</li>
		<li>Support for POST data parsing including file uploads</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Some examples in this document use ECMAScript 6, and currently require use of a transpiler such as <a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank">Babel</a>. While Breadbox uses ES6 internally, there is no requirement that you use it in your app.</p>
