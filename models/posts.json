{"automating-everything":{"title":"Automating Everything","body":"&lt;p&gt;At my company, we lack a designer-friendly development environment. The best solution I&#39;ve seen was at a previous company, and involved giving designers access to CSS files via Dropbox and syncing them to a dev box. I&#39;ve tried and failed to come up with a similar solution that suits our more complex needs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks largely to an unyielding corporate proxy, we don&#39;t do local development. To work on a Django project, for example, I mount a remote filesystem on my machine, SSH into the remote to run Grunt, and SSH in again in a second tab to use git.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is fine for a dev, but it causes serious problems for folks who don&#39;t use the command line. For starters, it throws git GUIs out the window (they don&#39;t work well in a mounted repo). But then there are the standard workflow tasks that use a terminal - getting new dependencies, restarting the server when code or configs change, compiling stuff... it&#39;s not fair of us to ask designers to think about all of this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;At one point we had a poor designer using an environment that involved booting a Vagrant VM, SSHing into it to run Grunt, then in another tab mounting the VM on her local and using git. Despite the frame of sticky notes around her desktop detailing&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;code&gt;sshfs user@host:path mountpoint&lt;br&gt;[wait for connection]&lt;br&gt;ssh user@host&lt;br&gt;[wait for connection]&lt;br&gt;cd path&lt;br&gt;grunt watch&lt;br&gt;[open new tab]&lt;br&gt;ssh user@host&lt;br&gt;[wait for connection]&lt;br&gt;cd path&lt;br&gt;[start editing]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I&#39;m far from the first one to write some scripts to automate this kind of dev environment log in process. But in the process of automating some of my own processes, I realized I could really help out&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"}}
